# PNG-predictors-of-spatial-forest-loss
Supplementary code for the WCS report on PNG REDD+ National circumstances report 2016.
___________________________________________________

We have uploaded the R code for doing the spatial analysis as outlined in our report.

To undertake the analysis you must first have access to the GEOBOOK and PNGRIS datasets created by the University of Papua New Guinea 
Remote Sensing Unit. 

Also you must have copies of the global forest change datasets for Papua New Guinea which are downloadable from:
http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest

Helpful in understanding the gfcanalysis package is Alex Zvoleff's site:
http://azvoleff.com/articles/analyzing-forest-change-with-gfcanalysis/

The code is separately by data layer. While we have made every attempt to make the code easily understandable idiosyncrasies
in PNGRIS and GEOBOOK mean that for some provinces data is split and batch processing won't work but rather has to be undertaken 
manually. 

Please notify me of any issues you identify in the code.

Cheers,
     Nathan
